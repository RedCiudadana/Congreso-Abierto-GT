<p>
The Participatory Politics Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with a mission to increase civic engagement. <br><br>

We believe that the Web has created an unprecedented opportunity for individuals to educate themselves in public affairs and amplify political actions. Every day, our lives abound in political feelings and opinions. Not just on Election Day.
</p>

<p>
Since 2007, PPF has made some of the leading sites on the Web for government transparency and accountability. Our work is free of charge, open-source, non-partisan, and non-profit. Our speciality is taking government data and making it more user-friendly:

<li>Uniquely combines official government info with news & blog coverage, campaign contribution data, and engagement tools</li>
  
<li>A key piece of civic infrastructure, with up to 1 million visits per month, 2.75 million page views per month, and 200,000 users</li>

<h2 class="center">We have a good start, with big plans</h2>

<p>PPF's goal is to increase our non-profit organization's resources and thereby our output of free tools for political participation.</p>
  
<p>Our vision is of a more "participatory politics" through technology: not only open data for government transparency, but also user-friendly web apps for millions of people worldwide to be meaningfully involved in their communities.</p>

<p>This is the potential of free software on the open Web: a more deliberative democracy, reduced corruption and increased faith in government, better public policy outcomes, and healthier communities. <strong>Our needs include the following</strong>:</p>

<li>Funding support for core maintenance of our massive database on the open Web, which fulfills millions of automated requests for information every week.</li>

<li>Improve our new features: Contact-Congress, the easiest way to email all three of your members of Congress; and MyOC Groups, for grassroots organizing around bills and issues.</li>

<li>Get members of Congress engaged on the site. Turn OC into a two-way platform for continual constituent communication and a forum for participatory budgeting. </li>
</ul>

<li>Bring OG down to the city level by incorporating municipal government data, aiming to support dozens of major cities & more localities</li>

<li>Expand OG abroad in partnership with #opengov advocates in other countries, as well as transparency for international institutions like the U.N. and E.U.</li>

</h2>

<div class="grid_12">  


<ol>

<li>   (PPF + PCF) collaboration: revamped <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Project:RaceTracker" target="_blank">AdTracker</a> for 2012 federal elections, an open platform for tracking campaign videos built on open-source <a href="http://www.mirocommunity.org/" target="_blank">Miro Community</a> software and incorporating information, context, and public opinion from OpenCongress (for federal races) & OpenGovernment (for state & city elections). Proposed video hub will meet public demand for authoritative official information, collaborative fact-checking, campaign donation data, interest group analysis, and improving civility of political discourse. This is yet another much-needed and immediately-useful open-source product for the public benefit. </li>
<li>
State, city, and local dashboards of constituent opinion - currently, hyper-local Web portals don’t offer a digestible overview of what political issues constituents care about and specific bills or community issues on which they’re communicating with officials. From users who opt-in to register with their address, OpenCongress can display civic actions at the level of states, cities (5-digit zip codes), down to city blocks (zip plus-four). It’s a powerful new view towards accountability in government.</li>
<li>
Money-in-politics message-builder for Rootstrikers & other reformers - new features will make it easier than ever to enforce public accountability “with teeth”. Users can alert elected officials that they’re tracking campaign contributions, down to specific donations from businesses & lobbyists, then organizing other constituents around the bills & issues they support. </li>
<li>
Additional project areas include campaigns around the following: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting" target="_blank">range voting</a>, <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/" target="_blank">net neutrality</a>, <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/content/section/category/redistricting/" target="_blank">non-partisan re-districting</a>, comprehensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_reform" target="_blank">electoral reform</a>, <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/universal-voter-registration" target="_blank">universal voter registration</a>, right-to-vote laws, revoking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood" target="_blank">corporate personhood</a>, and encouraging independent political parties for a more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system" target="_blank">parliamentary system</a> & substantively <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy" target="_blank">representative democracy</a>.</li>

<p class="grid_6 alpha">Help us grow and build amazing new tools for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy" target="_blank">deliberative democracy</a>. <a href="http://www.participatorypolitics.org/about/" target="_blank">Our team</a> has a strong reputation record of building truly popular products, but our limiting factor is a lack of major funding support for open-source non-profit software & Web applications. With additional tax-exempt donations to our non-profit organization for open-source Web development time, we can create popular technology that delivers the wide-ranging benefits of a strong democracy. A public resource of our size, that has received over a million visits per month, deserves a not-for-profit support team far larger than the one we currently can afford.</p>

“I have been hankering for this resource for some time now! I received this e-mail from our executive director at Families and Friends of Louisiana’s Incarcerated Children.  I often used OpenCongress working with organizations in DC and thought, how can we get local coverage & if it was even possible. This is truly great work and we will be excited to use it this session when we are hoping to see some reforms pass.”

OpenGovernment is the first open-source & non-profit website to bring together official information, campaign contribution data, social wisdom through news & blog coverage, and public comments in one place. </p>

<p>
The site’s main categories of information are bills, votes (with full roll call visualizations), legislators (both upper & lower chambers), committees, issue areas, businesses and individual donors from FollowTheMoney & MAPLight.org. Additional context is provided by special interest group analysis, videos (using the open-source Miro Community platform), community wiki project and “key vote” summaries from Project VoteSmart.</p>
